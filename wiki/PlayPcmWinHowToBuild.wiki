= How to build PlayPcmWin =

== Prerequisites ==

 * Windows 7 x64 or Windows Vista x64
 * Visual Studio 2010
 * TortoiseSVN
 * Lhaplus or equivalent archive file extractor

== Download PlayPcmWin sourcecode =

Open windows explorer, create C:\work\BpsConvWin2 and right-click the BpsConvWin2 folder and `[`SVN Checkout...`]` to open Checkout dialog. Enter the following URL on `[`URL of repository`]`

http://bitspersampleconv2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

== Create LocBaml_x64.exe and LocBaml_x86.exe =

Download LocBaml SDK from the following page:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms746621.aspx

Run Visual Studio 2010 and Load locbaml_sdk.sln

Open `[`Project`]``[`Configuration manager`]`, select x64 platform and rebuild the solution. copy resulted locbaml.exe to C:\work\BpsConvWin2\PlayPcmWin\LocBaml_x64.exe

Open `[`Project`]``[`Configuration manager`]`, select x86 platform and rebuild the solution. copy resulted locbaml.exe to C:\work\BpsConvWin2\PlayPcmWin\LocBaml_x86.exe

== Prepare libFLAC_static.lib and libogg_static.lib ==

Download libogg-x.y.z.tar.gz source code from the following site:
http://xiph.org/downloads/

Extract onto C:\work folder. Open C:\work\libogg-x.y.z\win32\VS2010\libogg_static.sln and release-build libogg_static.lib

Download flac-x.y.z.tar.gz source code from the following site:
http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html

Extract it onto C:\work folder. Open C:\work\flac-s.t.u\FLAC.sln. select release build. right-click libFLAC_static on the solution explorer and `[`Property`]` to open libFLAC_static property page. on the page, Select `[`VC++ directories`]``[`include directories`]` and append *C:\work\libogg-x.y.z\include* 

I suppose additionally the NetWide assembler is needed for FLAC build. it can be downloaded from the following site:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nasm/

== Build PlayPcmWin ==

Open C:\work\BpsConvWin2\PlayPcmWin\PlayPcmWin.sln

Select build target (Release x64 or Release x86). Right-click PlayPcmWin and flag as startup project and build.

I suppose libFLAC_static.lib and libogg_static.lib must be specify somewhere to build successfully. please play it by ear if any problem arises.
